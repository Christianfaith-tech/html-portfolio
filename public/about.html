<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Christian Faith-a full-stack developer with a strong passion for building practical, user-centered web applications.
My journey started with the basics of HTML, and over time, I've expanded into full-stack developer, learning how to bring
both the front and backends of a project together seamlessly.</p>

<p>I've worked on a range of projects, from personal websites like birthday invites to more complex, dynamic apps. I enjoy the full 
process-designing clean interfaces, making sure everything works as smoothly as it should. I'm always learning, growing, and looking
for new ways to solve real problems through code.</p>

<p>I'm currently open to new opportunities where i can contributes, and continue building solutions that matter.</p>
